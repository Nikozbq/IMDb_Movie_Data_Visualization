# IMDb Movie Data Visualization

In collaboration with Ruiqi Chen and Jinjia Zhang, we crawled IMDB movie data based on Python and visualized it using Javascript and HTML. Our data, code, and final presentation report and poster are shown here.

If you wish to run our code to see the visualization, please read below:

Simply put all the files in the same path and run dashboard.html using Vscode (recommended).

#1 Final_IMDb_Scraper.ipynb: Can grab web data from IMDb-Genres (after filtering), IMDb-chartbox (after selection) and IMDb-top (after filtering). Also included is the first data cleaning step in the scraping process. Simply replace the html links in the code and run all the programs to get the raw dataset.

#2 Data_cleaning.ipynb: The second process of data cleaning based on the raw data set grabbed from Final_IMDb_Scraper.ipynb. Simply run it and fetch the .csv file for later visualization.
